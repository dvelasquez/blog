Hi, my name is **Danilo Velásquez Urrutia**, I’m a Chilean **software engineer**
living in the sunny city of **Barcelona**.

I’ve been working as a **software engineer** since 2010. Over the years I’ve
worked with technologies such as **J2EE, .NET, Javascript, Typescript** among
others.

I love the web and what represents. Their **openness and accessibility** is
something that drew me to work on it. Since 2005, I’ve been doing **FrontEnd
development**, where my main concerns have been on **how teams work**, and **how
our users feel our products**.

Since 2019, I’ve been actively **working to helping other teams** to **improve
their performance** and **the performance of their products.**

Lately, I’ve been **working with some of the most visited pages** in **Italy**,
**Belarus** and **Hungary**, helping them to **detect where the performance
issues are**, and how to **help them to overcome it**.

From my perspective, there are two important things, **user experience and
developer experience (UX/DX)**, and I truly believe that (as
[Richard Branson accurately pointed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pavelkrapivin/2018/07/09/sir-richard-bransons-5-billion-reasons-to-make-your-employees-candidates-happy/#3df5574a6710))
_if you take care of your people, they will take care of the business
themselves_.
