This is based on a post published originally on [Quora in Spanish](https://es.quora.com/Cu%C3%A1ndo-puedes-considerarte-un-buen-programador) 

This is a very good (and often) question, and this reminds me of another question from Quora:  [As an 18-year-old with 2 years of experience, can I get a job as a senior developer?](https://www.quora.com/As-an-18-year-old-with-2-years-of-experience-can-I-get-a-job-as-a-senior-developer) 

This post walks through something called the **[Dunning-Krugger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)**, and this can be summarised with the following graph:

There is an interesting effect that happens to **junior developers**, who very often **thinks that they know everything about development**, but after a while, they start realising that there is **a lot more to learn**. This sometimes drove them to **feel overwhelmed** about **how little they know**. Some of them even **feel bad** because of this, and **their growth gets truncated**.

If you feel like this, **you are not alone!** In fact, for some time **I felt like this myself!**

For me, my learning experience in Software Development was something like this:

*   First I learnt **Excel**, **how to use functions** like **IF** and **VLOOKUP** (at this point, **I wasn’t even thinking on pursue a career in software engineering**, I was only a **data entry guy**)
*   Then, I learnt **Java**, (if, case, for, **OOP**)
*   Then, I got **my first job**, **maintaining** and **developing** forms with **.NET** (in this gig I was the **only developer in the team**, with **zero experience** working professionally. I was even **versioning my code in Dropbox** because I didn’t know that **SVN** or **GIT** existed!)
*   Then I learnt **libraries** and **frameworks** such as **Spring**, **Struts**, **myBatis** and the **MVC architecture** (at this point, I was in the **peak of the mount stupidity**, thinking “_Now I know everything about software development_”)
*   Later, in a **job** **interview**, I was asked about **design patterns** such as **Factories**, **Facades**, **DRY**, **KISS** (and **I felt stupid and overwhelmed** since there was **much more to learn**).
*   And then, **SOLID** (this is the part I realised that **I knew nothing about software development**, and out **there are people WAY better than me**). Here I was _in the lower part of the curve_.
*   And because of this, I learnt that the **Architecture is more important than languages and frameworks** (and how pointless is engage in fanatic discussions about which language is better)
*   Nowadays, I’m using **Clean Architecture** and **Hexagonal Architecture** whenever I can.
*   And there is a _long way of learning_, **DDD**, **BDD**, **Event Sourcing** and so much more to know.

A decisive point was, got over the fight of “**Java vs .NET vs PHP vs Python vs Javascript**” and understand that **languages are just a tool to achieve a goal, not the goal itself**. **Every language excels in something**, and some of them are **really good** in a **very specific domain** or context.

So, personally, **I think you can consider yourself a good developer when you truly assimilate that languages don’t matter that much, but having a clear specification is more important**.
