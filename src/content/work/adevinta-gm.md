As a Staff frontend specialist my mission is to share knowledge between the international teams in the Global Markets portfolio (Italy, Hungary, Mexico, Belarus, Austria and Ireland), spreading knowledge,best practices and helping to shape communities between these organisations.
I'm part of a global initiative to measure, monitor and improve the Page Speed of our marketplaces.

During this time I have:
- Created the infrastructure to reliably gather page speed metrics over time using Lighthouse, Prometheus and Grafana
- Helped marketplaces in Italy, Belarus, Hungary, Austria and Chile to start tracking their own Page Speed metrics.
- Helped our Italian marketplace Subito to improve their page speed performance score from 27/100 to 53/100
- Helped Subito to reduce their Time to Interactive from ~30 secs to ~7 secs
- Helped one of our marketplaces to overachieve their monetisation goals in a 5% using Prebid
- Helped Willhaben to improve their page speed performance score from 35/100 to 59/100
- Helped Jofogas to improve their First Contentful Paint from ~12 secs to 3.9 secs
- Helped Jofogas to improve their Largest Contentful Paint from ~20 secs to 8.8 secs
- Helped Jofogas to revamp their E2E testing architecture, increasing the coverage and reducing testing time in a 75%

I've also helped these marketplaces by:
- Creating and configuring Monorepo/Multipackages with Lerna, TypeScript and Rollup.
- Setting up pipelines to automatise their building, testing and validation processes.
- Designing the foundation for future iteration of the web platforms in the company.
- Teached/Mentored several software engineers.
