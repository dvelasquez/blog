            Is your engineering environment feeling "small or slow"? Are your tools, pipelines, and architecture struggling to keep up with your team's growth?

          <p class="animate">
            I help engineering organizations scale their platforms, people, and processes. As a Staff Engineer who has scaled systems for hundreds of developers at <a href="https://www.leboncoin.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>leboncoin.fr</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.kleinanzeigen.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kleinanzeigen</strong></a>, I solve the complex bottlenecks in <strong>platform engineering</strong>, <strong>developer experience (DevEx)</strong>, and <strong>systems architecture</strong>.

            <h3 class="animate font-semibold">1. Platform & DevEx Acceleration</h3>
            <ul class="animate space-y-2">
              <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A top-to-bottom audit and rebuild of your development and deployment pipeline. We find what's "slow" and make it fast.</li>
              <li><strong>What you deliver:</strong> A pragmatic, actionable roadmap to fix your CI/CD, testing, and infrastructure bottlenecks. I'll apply the same principles I used at <a href="https://www.leboncoin.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>leboncoin.fr</strong></a> to:
                <ul class="animate ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
                  <li><strong>Migrate your entire CI/CD</strong> from legacy systems (like Travis) to modern platforms (like GitHub Actions).</li>
                  <li><strong>Crush CI times</strong> from 1-2 hours down to <strong>under 10 minutes</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Optimize infrastructure</strong>, in one case reducing production pods from ~500 to ~150.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams held back by slow builds, flaky tests, and a high Mean Lead Time for Changes (MLTC).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="space-y-3">
            <h3 class="animate font-semibold">2. Modern Architecture & Migration Strategy</h3>
            <ul class="animate space-y-2">
              <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A strategic plan to scale your architecture and your engineering organization together.</li>
              <li><strong>What you deliver:</strong> A clear path forward, whether it's designing a <strong>scalable monorepo</strong> or <strong>migrating a legacy monolith</strong>. I'm currently leading this at <a href="https://www.kleinanzeigen.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kleinanzeigen</strong></a>, migrating a jQuery/Java SpringBoot system to a <strong>Node.js, Astro, and React</strong> stack, resulting in a <strong>5x improvement in development speed</strong> for the teams involved.</li>
              <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Organizations struggling with a monolith, scaling to 100+ engineers, or needing to design a high-performing monorepo for shared packages and micro-frontends.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="space-y-3">
            <h3 class="animate font-semibold">3. Staff+ & Neurodiversity Mentorship</h3>
            <ul class="animate space-y-2">
              <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A 1-on-1 mentorship program for engineers and leaders. This program has two tracks:
                <ol class="animate ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
                  <li><strong>Technical Leadership:</strong> A structured growth plan for Senior engineers on the path to Staff/Principal. We focus on technical strategy, architectural vision, and cross-team influence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Navigating the Workplace:</strong> Dedicated, empathetic coaching for <strong>neurodivergent (ND) professionals</strong>. If you are struggling with your work environment and would like the perspective of someone who has navigated it, I am here to help.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Ambitious engineers, new Staff-level leaders, and any neurodivergent professional in tech seeking confidential guidance.</li>

        <ul class="animate space-y-2">
          <li><strong>CTOs or VPs of Engineering</strong> at scaling companies whose teams are "feeling slow" and blocked by their platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering Managers or Directors</strong> who need a concrete plan for a complex, large-scale migration (e.g., monolith to micro-frontends).</li>
          <li><strong>Senior Engineers</strong> on the path to Staff who need a mentor to guide them.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurodivergent Professionals</strong> in tech who would like coaching from someone with shared experience.</li>

        <h2 class="animate text-lg font-semibold">My Consulting Philosophy: Pragmatism over Dogma</h2>
        <article class="space-y-4">
          <p class="animate">My approach is built on one core idea: <strong>"Change is Requirement #0."</strong></p>
          <p class="animate">I don't believe in "best practices" that don't fit your context. As a self-taught engineer from a humanities background, I see code as prose and architecture as a story.</p>
          <p class="animate">My job isn't to force my opinions. It's to act as a <strong>teacher and a problem-solver</strong>. I'll become a historian of your system, understand <em>why</em> it was built, and give your team the context, real-world experience, and confidence to make the best decision for your specific case.</p>
